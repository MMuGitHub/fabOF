Description: Implementation of Frequency Adjusted Borders Ordinal Forest (fabOF; Buczak, 2024) for prediction of ordinal responses based on random forest.
    Extends classical random forest for ordinal responses by assigning numeric scores to response categories. 
    Prediction of unseen observations through numeric category borders determined by a heuristic based on the cumulative frequencies of the ordinal response categories.
