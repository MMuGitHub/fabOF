\item{borders}{Either a numeric vector of category borders or the string "auto" or "none".
If numeric vector, specifies the borders for category background mapping. If "auto" (default), uses
the model's category borders. If "none", no background mapping is shown.
Default is "auto".}

\item{category_colors}{Character vector of colors for category backgrounds.

plots for categorical variables. Default is 0.8.}

Works for all plot types (continuous/categorical X, conditional/unconditional). Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{cond_color_var}{Character string specifying the name of a second predictor variable
to use for conditional coloring of ICE curves. When specified, ICE curves are colored by this
variable to explore potential interactions. Default is \code{NULL} (no conditional coloring).}

\item{cond_color_levels}{Character vector or named list specifying which levels/ranges to color.
For categorical variables: character vector of factor levels (if NULL, uses first 3-5 levels).

specifying ranges, e.g., \code{list("Low" = c(0, 5), "High" = c(5, 10))}.}

\item{cond_color_palette}{Character vector of colors to use for conditional coloring.
If NULL, uses a default color palette. Length should match number of conditioning levels/ranges.}

\item{cond_color_title}{Character string for the conditional color legend title.
If NULL, uses the variable name from \code{cond_color_var}.}

\item{cond_color_foreground}{Character vector specifying the plotting order of conditioning variable
levels from back to front (first element plotted first/in background, last element plotted last/in foreground).
For categorical variables: provide a vector of level names in desired order.
For continuous variables: provide a vector of range names in desired order.
If only one value is provided, that level is plotted on top with others in default order underneath.
If NULL, default plotting order is used. Only applicable for continuous X with conditional coloring.}

\item{show_category_background}{Logical. Controls colored backgrounds/fills for category mapping:
\itemize{
  \item For continuous X: Shows colored background rectangles.
  \item For categorical X (unconditional): Controls density ridge fill coloring by category.

}
Default is \code{TRUE} when \code{cond_color_var = NULL}, \code{FALSE} otherwise.}

\item{fit}{A fitted \code{ranger} model object.}
}
\value{
If \code{verbose = FALSE}, returns a ggplot object. If \code{verbose = TRUE},
 returns a list with elements:
 \item{plot}{The ggplot object}
 \item{data}{List containing ice_data and pdp_data tibbles}
 \item{variable_type}{Character indicating whether variable was treated as "categorical" or "continuous"}
}
\description{
This function creates partial dependence plots (PDP) with individual conditional
expectation (ICE) lines for ordinal random forest models. It automatically detects
whether the predictor variable is continuous or categorical and creates appropriate
visualizations. For continuous variables, it shows ICE lines with optional category
background mapping. For categorical variables, it creates ridgeline plots showing
the distribution of predictions for each category. test
}
\details{
The function automatically detects the variable type based on the original data:
\itemize{
 \item \strong{Categorical treatment}: Variables are treated as categorical if they are
  factors, characters, or have 4 or fewer unique values. A warning is displayed
  when numeric variables are treated as categorical due to having few unique values.
 \item \strong{Continuous variables}: Creates a traditional PDP with ICE lines,
  PDP mean line, and optional category background mapping using the \code{borders} parameter.
 \item \strong{Categorical variables}: Creates ridgeline plots showing the
  distribution of ICE predictions for each category level, with PDP mean points.
 \item \strong{Conditional ICE plots}: When \code{cond_color_var} is specified, ICE curves
  are colored by a second predictor variable to explore potential interactions (as recommended
  by Strobl et al. 2024). For continuous x-variables, ICE lines are colored by the conditioning
  variable. For categorical x-variables, separate density ridges are created for each combination
  of the x-variable and conditioning variable levels. By default, category background coloring
  is disabled when conditional coloring is active, showing only vertical lines at category borders.
